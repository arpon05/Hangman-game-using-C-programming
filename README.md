# Hangman-game-using-C-programming
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that is typically played between two people. One person thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. 
The word to be guessed is represented by a series of blanks, each blank representing a letter in the word.
The guessing player suggests letters one at a time, and the other player reveals whether the guessed letter is in the word. If the guessed letter is correct, 
it is filled in the corresponding blanks; if it is incorrect, a part of a stick figure (representing a hangman) is drawn. The objective is for the guessing player 
to correctly guess the entire word before the hangman figure is completed.
The hangman figure is typically drawn in stages, with each incorrect guess resulting in the addition of a new body part (head, body, arms, legs, etc.). 
The game continues until the guessing player correctly guesses the word or the hangman figure is completed.
The challenge for the guessing player is to deduce the hidden word by making strategic letter guesses while avoiding the completion of the hangman figure. 
Hangman is a popular game for its simplicity and can be played with words of various difficulty levels, making it suitable for players of all ages.
